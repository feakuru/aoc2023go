# feakuru@aoc2023 - go

This is my attempt at Advent of Code 2023. This is my first time doing this, and I'm doing it in two languages: [Python](https://github.com/feakuru/aoc2023go) and Go (this repo). I am not doing this for speed, but to remember and get some practice at implementing various algorithms in different languages.
